# Assemble Process

So the assemble process was sort of straightforward. It was not easy to do, but even without a manual \(that did not came\) you should be able to figure out what piece goes where. We were in 4 persons, we started just after lunch \(about 1PM\) and took us about 6 – 7 hours to get it assembled.

I also decided to inject Polyurethane Foam into the dish tube, so when it rains it doesn’t get filled with water. The only tip I have is: Be careful, your dish can grow balls.

So the dish assemble is done. Now we need to worry about the feed.
