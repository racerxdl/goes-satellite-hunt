# Image Navigation Record

This header is one of the most interesting things you can get. It is used to map a specific pixel to a coordinate \(latitude / longitude\) in the image \(and vice-versa\). This header is not mandatory on any of the images, and some satellite relays doesn't include it. For example Himawari 8 relays over GOES-16 doesn't include Navigation Record. Open Satellite Project uses this header to generate Map Overlays and to define the coordinate of the center of the image \(useful for non full disk scans\).

| Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Projection Name | string \( 32 \) | The name of the Image Projection |
| Column Scaling Factor | uint32\_t | The Scaling Factor for each column |
| Line Scaling Factor | uint32\_t | The Scaling Factor for each line |
| Column Offset | uint32\_t | The Offset for Columns |
| Line Offset | uint32\_t | The Offset for Lines |

### Table 7 - Image Navigation Record Fields

For calculation of the Lat/Lon Coordinates a mathematical model described in [CGMS 03 - LRIT/HRIT Global Specification](http://www.cgms-info.org/documents/pdf_cgms_03.pdf) \(page 20\) should be used. A pratical implementation can be found on [Open Satellite Project GeoTools Class](https://github.com/opensatelliteproject/goesdump/blob/master/XRIT/Geo/GeoTools.cs).
