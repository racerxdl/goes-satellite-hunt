# Image Data Function Record

This header describes the physical meaning of the Image included in the LRIT File. It may contain calibration data depending on the image type.

### Table 8 - Image Data Function Record Fields

The _Data_ field is consisted by several map values in `key := value` format with some special meanings.

| Key | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| $HALFTONE | Specifies a Halftone Grayscale Data. |
| $DISCRETE | Specifies a Discrete Type that each value has a specific meaning |
| $OVERLAY | Specifies a Overlay Data |
| \_NAME | Name of the image |
| \_UNIT | Unit used for the data |
| _a number_ | A map to defined values |

This is usually used for marking overlays or calibration data. One great example to explain is a thermal infrared channel that has a map for each pixel value to it's corresponding temperature. In this case, there will be a _$HALFTONE_ field defined with the number of bits that are relative to the map,  a _\_UNIT_ field with the type of unit, for example _Degrees Kelvin_, and then several `number := number` maps representing each value. For example:

```
$HALFTONE:=8
_NAME:=Calibrated Infrared
_UNIT:=Degree Kelvin
0:=330
1:=329.5
2:=329
3:=328.5
4:=328
5:=327.5
6:=327
7:=326.5
8:=326
9:=325.5
10:=325
11:=324.5
12:=324
13:=323.5
(...)
```

A pixel with value 11 mean its temperature is 324.5 Degrees Kelvin.
