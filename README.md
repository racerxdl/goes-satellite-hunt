# GOES Satellite Hunt

This book is adaptation of my blog post [GOES Satellite Hunt](http://www.teske.net.br/lucas/2016/10/goes-satellite-hunt-part-1-antenna-system/) that was published in the end of 2016 while I was reverse engineering the satellite signal. I'm doing this book to have a more organized document about GOES-13 Signals and also to keep up to date with my GOES-16 Reverse Engineering that followed the GOES-13 Reverse Engineering. This book will also be hosted at GitHub in [Create Commons Share Alike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/br/) license and any fixes are welcome from anyone. In the future I plan to add information about other satellites that use similar down link protocols like MSG-3 \(Meteosat 10\).

I also need to thank all people in \#hearsat @ starchat \(IRC\) for the help I got understanding SDR and Satellite Signal stuff, since when I started that I had no knowledge at all about it. Special thanks for trango \([@usa-satcom](https://twitter.com/usa_satcom)\) and mybit \([@devnulling](https://twitter.com/devnulling)\) for all the help with previous experiences in the area. Also I need to thank all my family for supporting it putting several dishes and antennas all over the roof of our house.
