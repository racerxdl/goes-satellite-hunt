# The Demodulator

In last chapter I explained how I manage to build a reception system to get the GOES LRIT Signal. Now I will explain how to get the packets out of the LRIT signal. I choose the LRIT signal basically because of two reasons:

1. It contains basically all EMWIN data + Full Disks from GOES 13 and 15.
2. Less complexity on the demodulator side \(Simple BPSK Demodulator\)

This is the LRIT Specification \(theoretically\):
